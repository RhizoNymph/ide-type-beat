# ide-type-beat
This is just a simple react skeleton that functions like an IDE with collapsible/resizable sidebars and a bottom panel with a toolbar at the top that has buttons to collapse/expand the different components. Use this as a starting point for single page react apps if you want, I am and that's why it's here. I use @uiw/react-split.
